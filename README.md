# Coupon-Browser-Extension

This is a chrome broswer extension that shows you coupon codes that are available for the website 
you are currently on. Users have the option to submit a coupon code of there own if they have one.

## How to use the browser extension
The extension is not on the chrome store because I have not made a developer account, however follow the steps bellow
to get the extension available on your chrome browser:
* Download the code from my repository and unzip the folder
* Go to chrome settings

* Toggle developer mode on the top right corner
* Click on "Load unpacked" button
* Find the folder you unzipped in the first step and select it
* Enable the extention and you ready to use it

The extention will appear as an icon on the right of your screen. Click the icon to view available coupons
for the website you currently on or to submit one of your own.
